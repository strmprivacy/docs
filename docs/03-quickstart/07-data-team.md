To quickly grasp how to use STRM and demonstrate configurations, you can have a look at an open notebook we publish: *Data Team in a Day*

:::note
The notebook is "alive", in that we run and refresh data and update examples on a continuous basis.

## Data Team in a Day

[The notebook](https://deepnote.com/workspace/STRM-demos-2614c69d-1aae-4c75-a0b8-ee631006da30/project/Data-team-in-a-day-with-STRM-eb9f78ee-b796-48e5-b1ff-b77815a3952a/notebook/Anonymisation%20pipelines%20with%20STRM%20Privacy-681be7708cf844589c24db36e0a5d2d9) outlines all the steps involved in configuring your STRM account:

1. Emulate existing or collecting data
2. Create the data contract as annotation to the data
3. Process the data in both batch and streaming modes
4. Train a very simple model as an example of a data product
5. Bonus: transform towards a specific _K_ while retaining as much data signal as possible
