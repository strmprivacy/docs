# Batch processing

STRM Privacy can process your data in two ways:
1. [Streaming](docs/03-quickstart/01-streaming/index.md) data processing works on continuous streams of events.
2. in Batch mode, with data defined as files (typically csv files), and processing being done _per file_. This how
   typical [ETL Processing][ETL] works.

This section shows the quickstart articles related to batch processing.
