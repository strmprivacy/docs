STRM Privacy can process your data in two ways:

1. Streaming data processing works on continuous streams of events.
2. in [Batch mode](docs/03-quickstart/02-batch/index.md), with data defined as files (typically csv files), and processing being done _per file_. This how

This section shows the quickstart articles related to stream processing.
