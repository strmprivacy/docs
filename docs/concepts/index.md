## [the `strmMeta` section](strm-meta.md)

Each event schema has a STRM Privacy specific section in it. This page

## [Masked Fields](masked-fields.md)

Masking field values so their plain text value is never visible. Useful
for sharing data with third parties, and to prevent sensitive values
from being visible within the company.

## [Simple Schemas](simple-schemas.md)

Simple Schemas are an STRM Privacy specific format that can be used if
you donâ€™t need to use all the complexities of Avro schemas. A Simple
Schema is *translated* to Avro upon creation, and that Avro schema is
used in the engine.
