# What is STRM Privacy?

> Lightning fast, Privacy Secured, Customer Data - you can actually use

STRM Privacy is a data processing platform, that ensures that collected
data from a source is of a strictly defined shape and content, and that
it is compliant with all well known privacy regulations, such as
[GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/). We strive to help you to collect customer data
in real-time with privacy and usability built-in.

Data can be consumed through multiple channels, which then can be used
by you for analytics, data science, machine learning, or for storing it
in your data lake.
