# STRM Privacy

STRM Privacy is a privacy-focused data processing platform, that ensures that collected
data from a source is of a strictly defined shape and content (the Data Contract), and that
it is compliant with all well known privacy regulations, such as
[GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/). We strive to help you to collect customer data
in real-time or process data in batch with privacy and usability built-in.

Data can be consumed through multiple channels, which then can be used
by you for analytics, data science, machine learning, or for storing it
in your data lake. If you'd like to jump right in:

## Common use cases

As STRM Privacy supports both streaming and batch data pipelines, any use case can be enabled with our data processing
platform. Some examples of use cases:

* **E-Commerce platform customer journey tracking**. Decrease the time needed for your customers to find the product
  they are looking for by collecting data, respecting the customer's consent regarding data usage and still have the
  possibility to train Machine Learning models to assist the customer in their product journey.
* **App usage data**. Smartphone applications collecting data might contain sensitive identifiers that can be traced
  back to individuals. The app data can still be collected, only if the consent that is often an opt-out approach is
  provided. With STRM Privacy you can collect data, ensure that the sensitive data is protected while respecting the
  consent of the user.
* **Medical data**. With e-Health arising, data privacy becomes even more important than it already was in healthcare.
  For data analytics purposes, our platform can assist in ensuring that patient data stays secure, and that only
  specific employees get access to specific data.
* **Your use case?** Reach out to us and discuss your use case and see how STRM Privacy could help you streamline your
  the challenge of processing privacy-sensitive data.
