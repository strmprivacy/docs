# SaaS

As the name implies, STRM Privacy can provide the Data Plane as a Service. This is the default mode that STRM Privacy
is operating in when you first create your account. This is also the only mode that the account type with a free
subscription can run on.

Benefits of using the SaaS Data Plane:
1. Zero effort to deploy
2. Easy to get started
3. Upgrades are taken care of

You might consider [hosting your own Data Plane](./02-ccd.md), if:
1. You require data never leaving your (cloud) infrastructure
2. You require encryption keys never leaving your (cloud) infrastructure
3. You can benefit from (sustained) discounts for running your infrastructure resources

To start using the Data Plane in SaaS, follow along with the [language examples](docs/03-quickstart/01-streaming/03-sending-data/01-language-examples.md) in the quickstart section.
