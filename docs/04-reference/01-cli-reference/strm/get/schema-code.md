## strm get schema-code

Get schema code archive by data-contract-ref

### Synopsis

In order to simplify sending correctly serialized data to STRM Privacy it is recommended to use generated
source code that defines a class/object structure in a certain programming language, that knows (with help of some
open-source libraries) how to serialize objects.

The result of a `get schema-code` is a zip file with some source code files for getting started with sending events in a
certain programming language. Generally this will be code where youâ€™ll have to do some sort of `build` step in order to
make this fully operational in your development setting (using a JDK, a Python or a Node.js environment).

### Usage

```
strm get schema-code (data-contract-ref) [flags]
```

### Examples

```
strm get schema-code strmprivacy/example/1.5.0 --language=python
Saved to python-avro-example-1.3.0.zip
