# gRPC and CLI

STRM Privacy is controlled via gRPC APIs. The CLI is no more than an interface to this API, with an
authorization token. The [definitions are public on GitHub](https://github.com/strmprivacy/api-definitions).

In a similar way, the [STRM Console](https://console.strmprivacy.io) is also only an interaction with this API.

Because of this _api first_ design, it's quite feasible to _automate_ interaction of your systems with STRM.

:::note
To support Infrastructure as Code, we're planning on building a Terraform Provider.
Please [contact us](docs/05-contact/index.md) if you are interested in this.

# Interactive gRPC command line interface

[Evans](https://github.com/ktr0731/evans) is an API aware client for gRPC. It can interact with a server and via
reflection see exactly what services the server offers, through reflection. The CLI is only used to guide you through
the login process and getting an OAuth2.0 access token.

```bash
# Make sure you're logged in, otherwise login with:
strm auth login
```

```bash
evans -r repl --host api.strmprivacy.io --port 443 --tls \
      --header "authorization=Bearer $(strm auth print-access-token)" \
      --package strmprivacy.api.data_contracts.v1 \
      --service DataContractsService
```
```

The entire STRM Privacy API can be accessed this way. The `CLI` however, offers a way more convenient way to access the
CLI.
